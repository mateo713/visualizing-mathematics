# visualizing-mathematics
This is a personnal repository under the MIT license containing all my programs that are related to data visualization, in particular with matplotlib and visualizing mathematical formulas or concepts. 

Each folder contains the program, a python file, as well as a text explaining how the program works, what it does, how it should be used and potential other details.

Every program in this repository, that I plan on expanding, is to be used freely by people, mainly as a learning tool, either to learn a little more about python programming, or as a tool to visualize certain mathematical concepts.
